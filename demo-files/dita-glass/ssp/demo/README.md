# dita-glass
Samples for using "convert" protocol to convert various resources to DITA.

You need to install Oxygen XML Editor (or XML Author) version 17.0 or newer to run these conversions.

You can load in the Oxygen XML Editor project view the "sample.xpr" project which comes with this repository.

Then you can open the sample DITA Map, look how each reference is constructed and resolved via the XML catalog which comes with the project.

You can publish the DITA Map to WebHelp and PDF using the custom transformation scenarios which are saved at project level.
