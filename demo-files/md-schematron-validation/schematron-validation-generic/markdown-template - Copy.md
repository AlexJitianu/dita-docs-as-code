# Sharing a Project - Team Collaboration

You can use XML projects to make team collaboration and synergy efficient and effective. Not only can you share the project files and folders, 
but Oxygen XML Editor also allows you to store preferences, transformation scenarios, and validation scenarios at project level in a project file 
(.xpr file extension).

To share options that are configured in certain preferences pages, you can store them in a project file (.xpr file extension) that can easily be
shared with others. To do so, follow these steps:

1. You many want to use a fresh install for this procedure, to make sure that you do not copy personal or local preferences.
1. In the Project view, create a project or open an existing one.
1. Open the Preferences dialog box (Options > Preferences).
1. Configure the options in each preferences page that you want to be included in the project file and switch the storage preference to Project Options in each page.
1. Click OK and close the Preferences dialog box.
