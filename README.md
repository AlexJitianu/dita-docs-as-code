# dita-docs-as-code
A working example on how you can apply docs-as-code paradigm for a DITA project.

## Getting started

Perform the following steps:

1. Click the following button: [![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/AlexJitianu/dita-docs-as-code)
2. Click "Connect to GitHub". If you do not have a GitHub account, you can create one for free.
3. Choose a name for the new repository
4. Click "Save & Deploy"
5. You will be redirected to the project's Netlify home page. Meanwhile the PDF version of the paper starts to be generated. In approximately one minute your Dashboard will be deployed at the URL "https://\<project-id\>.netlify.com". You can change this URL in the "Settings" tab.
6. Open the Dashboard.
7. You can use the "View on GitHub" link to access the newly created GitHub repository. The repository is public by default. You can go to the **Settings** tab and make it private.
